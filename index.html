                <h2>TigerTech: Student Activities & Social Platform</h2>
                <p>Collaboratively designed and developed an interactive web platform to enhance student engagement on campus using Ruby on Rails. 
                    TigerTech serves as a central hub where students can sign up, connect with friends, and discover diverse clubs and activities tailored to their interests.
                    The website features a user-friendly interface for real-time messaging, club search functionality, and local dining in the area,
                    fostering a vibrant community atmosphere and promoting extracurricular participation. Our agile development approach and iterative testing ensured a robust
                    application that supports students in maximizing their campus experience.</p>

                <h2>UniChat: A Real-Time University Chat Application</h2>
                <p>Developed a server-client based application aimed at facilitating real-time communication among university students. 
                    Utilizing socket programming in Python, UniChat allows users to connect to a chat room, send and receive messages in real-time, 
                    and engage in dynamic discussions. The project involved creating both server and client-side scripts to handle multiple client connections, 
                    manage user interactions, and ensure smooth data transmission. This project not only honed my skills in network programming but 
                    also provided practical experience in developing real-time communication tools, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying network 
                    protocols and client-server architecture.</p>
